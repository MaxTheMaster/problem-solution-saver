# Problem &mp Solution Saver

This is a very simple python project that stores your code errors and problems, along with their solutions that you have found or figured out to a csv file, so that 
they can be referenced at a later date, incase you run into a similar error again, or just need to see how it was done. The solutions can be a link to a Youtube video, 
article, or stackoverflow. It can even be a short statement explaining your answer. Despite this being absolutely useless, it was fun to make. The program is called 
"Prolution" since it is an amalgamation of the words, problem and solution. All code is written in Python and the GUI was made with Tkinter. 

##Features:
-Storing to a csv file

-Deleting all stored items

-Viewing all stored items

##Note

This is not final product, some more features going to added in the future.
