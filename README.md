# problem-solution-saver

This is a very simple python project that stores your code errors and problems, 

along with their solutiions that you have found or figured out, to a csv file,

so that can be referenced at a later date, incase you run into a similar error

again, or just need to see how it was done. The solutions can be a link to a Youtube

video, article, or stackoverflow. It can even be a short statement explaining your answer.

Despite this absolutely useless, it was fun to make.
