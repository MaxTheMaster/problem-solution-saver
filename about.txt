This application allow you to save your 
errors, bugs and problems, along with 
their solutions, whether it be some code 
you figured out, a link to: a youtube video,
an article, or stackoverflow. Both are then 
saved in a csv file in the same row, with 
the problem under a column named problems 
and solutions under a column named solutions.
